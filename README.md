## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Deployment:** Streamlit
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
- **Normalization:** Scaled the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features from existing data to improve model performance.

## Clustering Techniques
Implemented various clustering algorithms using Scikit-learn to segment the customer data:
1. **K-means Clustering**


## Prediction Model
- **Decision Tree Model:** Developed to predict customer segments using the clustered training data, ensuring accurate classification and analysis.

## Deployment
- **Streamlit Application:** Yet to be deployed to provide real-time customer segmentation insights and visualizations, enhancing data-driven decision-making.

## Results
- Achieved a weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.93, demonstrating the effectiveness of the clustering and prediction models.
- Developed actionable insights for personalized customer recommendations.
